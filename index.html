    <p>The Pierce family has a long history of what some would call, Food Buffs. Consisting of Wayne and Beverly Pierce, the patriarch and matriach,
        and their three daughters; Lori Pierce, Keri Pierce, and Kim Bader. 
        <br>
        The three have lived very different lives since their departure from the nest but have always found common ground in their recipes and cooking.
